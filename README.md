# Silent Room Observer (SRO)
This is a compiled [AutoIT Script](https://www.autoitscript.com/) that uses [INetGetSource](https://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/docs/libfunctions/_INetGetSource.htm) to check for a valid URL by checking the response. If valid, it will then repeat the network requests on a interval, taking the response and using regular expressions to extract certain information. This code was a decompiled salavaged copy and can be cleaned up by using the native require includes within AutoIt. This code is published as the [Silent Room Observer](https://find.vu/downloads/sro/) program for the Find.vu website.

Compiled on Windows 10, AutoIT 3.3.16.0
